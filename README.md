# Hello-world


I'm John-just here to learn how to code and find something fun to do with my free time.
Very active individual with some free time to learn codes: CNC, Fanuc, Ruby and anything else?
I've gotten some coding experience with matlab and also a sumo-robot build with an 'unmentioned' code. 
If you've got an idea of what this sumo-robot ran on... go ahead and toss in the name here :: __    answered by-j
Github has formed a reputation for being a "go to" place for coders; so, here I am!
